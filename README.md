<h3>Learn to Code one byte at a time</h3>

<p>The goal of this project is to create a website that is a one-stop shop where learners of all ages can find free educational material with its primary focus being programming. There will be learning material and guides created by the host website as well as a regularly updated curated list of websites from other organizations with free material organized by topic. Learning is not a one-size fits all ordeal and students should be aware of all of the free options that are available to them.</p>
